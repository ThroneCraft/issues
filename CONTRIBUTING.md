**What we expect of your report/suggestion:**

We expect reports to have a clear description of desired and the actual behaviour. If you are reporting a possible security issue, please contact a staff member in private. Suggestions are expected to be applicable to a group of people, not just yourself. Before creating a report/suggestion please check if it has not been created before.

**What we expect of your behaviour:**

We expect that you behave according to the [server rules](https://thronecraft-server.enjin.com/forum/m/13784224/viewthread/32690109-thronecraft-server-rules) as far as applicable. Not doing so can result in a warning.
